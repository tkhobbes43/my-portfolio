# My Portfolio


## Description
Creating this has many purposes, but one of them is to showcase my skills.
This is also the perfect kind of practice, by applying what I learned to something that is useful.
I hope to learn how to perfect the use of HTML and CSS to get my portfolio a good base so that potential employers have the perfect resource to see what I can do.
